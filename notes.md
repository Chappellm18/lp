NRE -> RE -> Resursive Langauges -> Context Sensitive L -> Context Free L -> Regular Langauges

## Formal System 

- Axioms 
- Rules of Inference
- Theorem

### Example

P 

P -> q      
_______
Therefore q <-- modus ponens

a+b = b+a

## Consistent

- if you can prove that P is true and P is not true it doesnt work

### Example

p = true         |       2=3

p = not true     |       2=2

## Godel Incompleteness Theorem

- if you have a consistent formal system is it incomplete
